Version 1.0 of ChemAxiomPoly.owl is officially deprecated and only provided here for backwards compatibility purposes. The current version of the ontology has been
re-licencsed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, adopted a different upper ontology (GFO instead of BFO) and has been significantly refactored.
If you are beginning new projects and have not previously used the old version of ChemAxiomPoly.owl, please use the up-to-date release.
